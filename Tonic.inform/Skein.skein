You&apos;ve needed extra cash and this science lab was willing to pay good money for you to be a &quot;test bunny&quot;. You took this chemical mixture but it did nothing at first so the scientists left you alone in the test room until later on. After and hour you end up being shrunk to three inches tall. You now realize how serious these scientists are and you must figure out how to get yourself back to normal proportions and escape the lab

Test Room
Pitch white walls surround you. There is a tinted window on the north side of the room. There is a table on the south side of the room and a chair on the east side. On the west side of the room, there is a door.

You can see a Big Metal Door here.

It&apos;s not too different from the Test Room, just in hallway shape: There&apos;s those bright white walls and cold tile floor. The Test Room is to the East.
