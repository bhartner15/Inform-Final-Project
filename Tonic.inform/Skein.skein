You&apos;ve needed extra cash and this science lab was willing to pay good money for you to be a &quot;test bunny&quot;. You took this chemical mixture but it did nothing at first so the scientists left you alone in the test room until later on. After and hour you end up being shrunk to three inches tall. You now realize how serious these scientists are and you must figure out how to get yourself back to normal proportions and escape the lab

It&apos;s not too different from the Test Room, just in hallway shape: There&apos;s those bright white walls and cold tile floor. The Test Room is to the East. There&apos;s a door to the west that says &quot;Chemical Lab&quot; on it and to the south a door that says &quot;Exit&quot;. The Hallway continues to the north, past a trash can in the Northeast corner.

You can see an Exit Door, a Steel Door, a Big Metal Door and a Scientist here.
